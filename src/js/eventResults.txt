Before any calculations are done, we must accept at least these three values from DOM:

    From Inputs Dashboard:
    "Number of Individuals"
    "Time Horizon" (ALSO TO BE PASSED TO MARKOV FUNCTIONS)

    From Detailed Results:
    "Total Selected Employees"
    "% Among Employees w/ Overweight and Obesity classes"

    From Central Data Control:
    "Include direct costs" (Where is this in the DOM?)

    
    From Event-Based Analysis:
    - "Population of Interest" (Event_comorbidity_selection)
    - "AOM (inc. Wegovy) vs" (Event_comp_selection)
    - "View By (Events_PMPM)

    This way we should be able to only calculate and build the tables we need to display

    For instance:
    - if user selects HFpEF or Knee Osteoarthritis, build appropriate table,
      otherwise build CVD table

We may also need to accept:

    - "View by: Event rate / % Events" (Events_TOG_choice)
    - "Graph / Chart" (GraphToggleEventsSelected)
